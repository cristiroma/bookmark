# QueryElevationComponent
* https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryElevationComponent - The QueryElevationComponent enables you to configure the top results for a given query regardless of the normal lucene scoring. This is sometimes called "sponsored search", "editorial boosting" or "best bets". This component matches the user query text to a configured Map of top results. Although this component will work with any QueryParser, it makes the most sense to use with DisMax style queries.
